<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1">1</a> Introduction
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
In so far as each of the Department’s volunteer rescue squads desires to operate its own technical assets (ambulances, duty radios, etc) in the Virginia Beach EMS system, there exists a need to integrate those assets with municipal and regional infrastructure and processes. This document, along with any documents it references, specifies requirements for such integration.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> <a class="Label" name="subsec:Desired-state"> </a>Desired state
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
This document is written with the following high-level goals in mind:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
System integration concerns are defined before a procurement begins, and are raised at initiation of the procurement process.
</li>
<li>
Such definitions are composed of:<ul>
<li>
Written words
</li>
<li>
Charts
</li>
<li>
Drawings
</li>
<li>
Pictures
</li>

</ul>

</li>
<li>
Compliance with these requirements is verified prior to an asset being ordered.
</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Continuous process
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
This document is a work product intended to serve as the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of a dynamic &ldquo;hub-and-spoke&rdquo; process driven by progress. The &ldquo;spokes&rdquo; of the process include:
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1.2.1">1.2.1</a> Identification of control points in the procurement process
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
Control points are opportunities to assess compliance with requirements and to address any discrepancies. Currently-identified control points include when:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
A squad becomes interested in procuring a technical asset
</li>
<li>
A squad submits a grant application for DEMS or state approval
</li>
<li>
A squad submits a loan application for DEMS or city approval
</li>
<li>
A squad finishes a purchase or build order, and is ready to sign a contract
</li>
<li>
A squad performs an end-of-assembly inspection, or takes delivery of a technical asset
</li>
<li>
A squad submits an asset for integration into the Virginia Beach EMS system
</li>
<li>
An asset gets refurbished, rechassied, recapitalized, etc
</li>
<li>
The city budget planning process begins
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Standard">
The Department and the squad should review this document together at each control point to assess ongoing compliance with requirements.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1.2.2">1.2.2</a> Identification of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
This document is only as legitimate as the endorsements it receives from the appropriate authoritative personnel. As personnel move in, out, and across the workforce and the market, it is important that the Department review this document to assure that its references to, and endorsements from, SMEs are current, correct, and complete.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1.2.3">1.2.3</a> Interviews with SMEs
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
The Department should conduct periodic interviews with identified SMEs to review the contents of this document, and to gather:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
New, changed, or obsolete requirements
</li>
<li>
Supporting artifacts to include explicitly or by reference
</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1.2.4">1.2.4</a> Endorsements from SMEs
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
The Department should make sure that it gets an explicit endorsement from the appropriate SME for every set of integration requirements for a given system or subsystem. Such endorsements should be in writing and should be attached or otherwise made available with this document.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1.2.5">1.2.5</a> Advocacy for SMEs at appropriate control points
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
The Department should take at least each control point as an opportunity to raise stakeholder awareness of SME concerns. The Department acknowledges that the SMEs are not responsible for directly communicating new, changed, or obsoleted requirements directly to the squads, nor are the squads responsible for making direct inquiries to the SMEs. Rather, the SMEs are responsible for communicating changes to the Department, and the Department is responsible for communicating that information to the squads via this document (see <a class="Reference" href="#subsec:Desired-state">1.1↑</a>).<p><br/>

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2.1">2.1</a> Squad procurement cycle
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Squad coordinators who are responsible for technical asset procurement should perform most or all of the following &ldquo;cradle to grave&rdquo; tasks:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Recognize the need to procure an asset.
</li>
<li>
Ensure adequate squad funds are budgeted (also see section <a class="Reference" href="#sec:City-budget-process">2.2↓</a>).
</li>
<li>
Develop full specifications using this document as a guide.
</li>
<li>
Solicit quotes, bids, or proposals.
</li>
<li>
Issue a purchase order or sign a contract according to squad business rules.
</li>
<li>
Make sure payments are processed in a timely manner.
</li>
<li>
Ensure contract performance (inspect asset thoroughly using specifications and build order as guides).
</li>
<li>
For ops assets, turn asset over to ops staff for full commissioning.
</li>
<li>
Determine <u>well ahead of time</u> when an asset will no longer be of use or value.
</li>
<li>
For ops assets, receive decommissioned asset from ops staff.
</li>
<li>
Remove and reallocate useful sub-components (ie, EMS gear, radios, computers, dashcams, power load systems, etc, for a vehicle).
</li>
<li>
Remove highly conspicuous squad markings as necessary.
</li>
<li>
Initiate final sale or disposal process.
</li>

</h2>
<div class="Standard">
This document is primarily intended to define requirements for integrating <u>squad-owned</u> technical assets into city infrastructure, but in some cases a squad must consider <u>city</u> budgetary issues. For example, in the traditional arrangement for adding an ambulance to the VB EMS fleet, the EMS Department must seek and receive approval to pay for additional fuel, maintenance, city-supplied medical gear, etc. The timeline for this process is enforced by the Budget &amp; Management Services Department, the City Manager, and City Council – not by the EMS Department.
</div>
<div class="Standard">

<div class="Standard">
Because an MDT in a vehicle must be able to receive messages when the vehicle is off (unless voltage drop would risk preventing the vehicle from being started), all MDTs installed in vehicles must draw primary power from the following component, which must draw its power from the OEM unswitched battery circuit:
